	  		<h1>Surrounding Communities</h1>
				<h2>Bend</h2> 
				<p>Bend has been dubbed the outdoor playground of the West for a thousand good reasons, but there’s more to this magical place than outdoorsy fun.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Bend is a community of entrepreneurs, outdoor enthusiasts, community activists, and families.  Spending a night in Bend you are contributing to this fabulous community.  Let's keep it that way.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The Bend Pledge is our way of creating a code of conduct for everyone who spends time in Central Oregon. Take the Bend Pledge and leave Bend a little better than you found it. </p>

				<h2>Sisters</h2>
				<p>Sisters, Oregon (aka "Sisters Country") is a wonderland of lakes, mountains and rivers, a paradise for hikers, flyfishermen, paddlers, mountain bikers, birders, skiers and horseback riders. From the sagebrush of the high desert to the magnificent forests on the flanks of the Cascades, you'll find a lifetime's worth of exploration and adventure.</p>
				<br />
				<p>But that's not all Sisters Country offers. You can slough off the cares of the workaday world, relaxing in world-class lodgings, unwinding at delightful spas, and discovering the arts and crafts of Sisters in mom-and-pop shops. Get a hearty, old-fashioned breakfast or dine in casual elegance.</p>
				<br />
				<p>And Sisters is a center of arts and culture, offering events and activities of international renown, from the venerable Sisters Rodeo to the acclaimed Sisters Outdoor Quilt Show or the Sisters Folk Festival. </p>

				<h2>Redmond, Oregon</h2>
				<p>Redmond is located in the heart of Central Oregon and is known as the “Hub” for its central location and the cross roads of both highways 97 and 126. With direct access to all that Central Oregon has to offer, Redmond is the ideal place to start your adventure.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Getting here is half the fun, whether arriving from the west, where you crest the Cascade Mountains for your first scenic view, or enter from any other direction, you will instantly recognize you have arrived at a truly amazing destination.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Redmond has so much to offer, quaint shops, historic buildings, a vibrant brew scene, public art, music, charming parks, great schools, outstanding medical facilities and more.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Take one of Redmond’s walking tours, highlighting some of its many historic buildings, the Art Deco movement, and public art. You will discover first hand Redmond’s history is as unique as our residents are.</p>
				<br />
				<p>You will love the low-key lifestyle and the friendliness of our community.</p>
