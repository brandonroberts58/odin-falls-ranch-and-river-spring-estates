	  		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	  		<p>Odin Falls Ranch and River Springs Estates is a gated community within 10 minutes of Redmond, Oregon. Nestled among the Cascade Mountain Range it sits within walking distance of the beautiful Deschutes River. The homes here have fantastic views with some sitting right above the river. Much of the landscape is in its native state of old juniper trees and grasses which supports a myriad of wildlife. You will find the sunrises and sunsets spectacular. Redmond is home to the region's commercial airport and is located at the crossroads of US Highway 97 and US Highway 126.</p>
	  		<br />
			<p>The Redmond area offers an abundance of recreation opportunities. Try your hand at snowshoeing or sking the slopes of Mt Bachelor during the winter and fly fishing or rafting down the river in the summer. New, upscale restaurants, brewpubs, and farmers markets are becoming the norm in this fast-growing community. Add in a few music events or a rodeo out in the fresh mountain air and you will experience the richness of living in Central Oregon.</p>
